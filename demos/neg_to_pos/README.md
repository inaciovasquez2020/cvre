NEG → POS Demonstration

This demo illustrates a certified transition from impossibility to success.

At radius r = 0:
- Two candidates are locally indistinguishable.
- No admissible process can select a unique nearest neighbor.
- CVRE emits a NEG certificate with OBSTR_RADIUS_INDIFF.

At radius r = 1:
- Additional neighborhood structure is visible.
- The candidates become distinguishable.
- CVRE emits a POS certificate.

This demonstrates that CVRE distinguishes:
- algorithmic failure from
- structural impossibility from
- legitimate success.
