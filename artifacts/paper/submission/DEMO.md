# Certified NEG → POS Demonstration

This demo illustrates a certified transition from impossibility to success.

---

## Setup

Two candidate points are identical under locality radius r = 0.
No admissible process can distinguish them.

At radius r = 1, neighborhood structure becomes visible.

---

## Outcome

- r = 0 → NEG certificate  
  Obstruction: OBSTR_RADIUS_INDIFF

- r = 1 → POS certificate  
  Objective achieved legitimately

---

## Why This Matters

This demonstrates that CVRE distinguishes:
- algorithmic failure
- structural impossibility
- legitimate success

using explicit certificates rather than heuristics.
